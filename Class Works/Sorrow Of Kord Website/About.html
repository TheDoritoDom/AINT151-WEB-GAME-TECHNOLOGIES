<h1>About Myself:</h1>
<h4 style="color:black;"><b> Hi! My name is Dom Sleightholme and I am the creator of the Sorrow of Kord. This website is part of my assingment for degree what I am undertaking at Plymouth University. I enjoy socialising with others who have similar interests to me on games development, while I progress with my degree I want to advance in story telling and how the story can effect the player.</b></h4>
<h4 style="color:black;"><b>I want to take the time to say thank you for viewing my website and testing my game out, I have put a lot of effort into this project and wanted people to see what its become. Maybe in the future, Sorrow of Kord will become an RPG, adventure game what was made on Unity</b></h4>
